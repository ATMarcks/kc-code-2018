## Our Application

In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in the use of social media as a platform to interact with 
companies. Between January 2014 and July 2015 there was an eight-fold rise in the use of social media by consumers
as a method of voicing complaints.<sup>[1](https://www.instituteofcustomerservice.com/media-centre/press-releases/article/customer-complaints-see-8-fold-rise-on-social-media-1)</sup>
In 2017, over a third of consumers surveyed stated that they would use social media to voice complaints.<sup>[2](http://digitalmarketingmagazine.co.uk/social-media-marketing/complaining-consumers-target-retailers-through-social-media/4689)</sup>
With the sudden prevalence of social media as a method of interacting with businesses there is also a need for businesses to
quickly quantify public opinion and act upon this relatively new source of customer feedback.

Our application, Sentiment, addresses the problem of how businesses and organizations can quickly gather public sentiment
on social media about a certain topic. Evaluating general public sentiment online can be time-consuming, difficult to quantitate, or require custom
or highly specific software. Sentiment uses sentiment analysis, a process in which a positive or negative score is assigned to a number of recent
social media posts surrounding a specific topic and the scores aggregated. For example, polarizing words such as _awful_ or _great_
lower or raise the positivity score, respectively.

With Sentiment a business can quickly get a real-time snapshot of
public sentiment around a certain topic by typing in a hashtag. Our application also
gives the user a subset of the social media posts that were used in the analysis so that tailored action can be taken.
